üîß Prompt: Analyze Codebase and Document Existing Functional Features

You are tasked with analyzing an existing codebase and extracting its functionality into a human-readable, structured summary that will later be used to write a new Product Requirements Document (PRD). Follow the steps below carefully and thoroughly.


‚úÖ Objective

Create a file called existing_features.md that summarizes all high-level functions in the application and the business logic behind each function. This file will serve as the foundation for writing a new PRD that:
	‚Ä¢	Re-implements the existing functionality, and
	‚Ä¢	Allows for additional features to be added later.


üîç Step-by-Step Instructions
	1.	Analyze the Codebase:
	‚Ä¢	Traverse all relevant files (e.g., controllers, services, handlers, business logic layers).
	‚Ä¢	Identify major high-level functions or features.
	‚Ä¢	Group related behavior together logically (e.g., all payment-related logic under ‚ÄúProcess Payment‚Äù).
	2.	For Each Function:
	‚Ä¢	Create a top-level heading in the markdown file using the format: ### Function Name
	‚Ä¢	Use descriptive, business-relevant naming. Avoid generic method names like handleRequest().
	3.	Document Business Logic as Bullet Points:
	‚Ä¢	Under each function, list out individual pieces of business logic, one per bullet point.
	‚Ä¢	Describe the business purpose of each rule or check in clear, non-technical language.
	‚Ä¢	Maintain logical order based on the execution flow in code.
	‚Ä¢	Each bullet point should describe one business rule or decision.
	‚Ä¢	Include conditions, validations, calculations, or state transitions that affect functionality.
	4.	Be Precise and Unambiguous:
	‚Ä¢	Avoid vague phrases like ‚Äúdoes something‚Äù or ‚Äúmaybe adds a fee.‚Äù
	‚Ä¢	Do not include implementation details like method calls or database statements.
	5.	Format Output as a Markdown File:
	‚Ä¢	The final output must be valid Markdown syntax.
	‚Ä¢	Save the complete result into a file named: existing_features.md


‚úÖ Example of Good Output

Create Invoice
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the customer has an active account before generating an invoice.
	‚Ä¢	Skip invoice generation if there is no outstanding balance.
	‚Ä¢	Apply a 10% late fee if the invoice is more than 30 days overdue.
	‚Ä¢	Round all invoice line-item totals to two decimal places.
	‚Ä¢	Flag the invoice as ‚ÄúPending Approval‚Äù if the total exceeds $10,000.

‚ùå Examples of Bad Output

Bad:

Calls validateCustomer() and then generateInvoice().
‚úò Implementation detail ‚Äî not business logic.

Bad:

Checks balance and might add a fee?
‚úò Vague and ambiguous.

Bad:

Contains logic for creating invoices.
‚úò Not broken down into discrete business rules.

‚∏ª

üìÑ Output Deliverable
	‚Ä¢	A single file named existing_features.md
	‚Ä¢	Organized using markdown headings and bullet points
	‚Ä¢	Clear, unambiguous, and business-focused descriptions of each functional feature
