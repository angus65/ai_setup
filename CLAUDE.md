# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is an AI setup repository that appears to be in initial setup phase. The repository is configured for Node.js/JavaScript development based on the `.gitignore` file patterns, but no source code or package configuration has been added yet.

## Current Configuration

- `.gitignore`: Configured for Node.js/JavaScript projects with common ignore patterns
- `.claude/settings.local.json`: Contains permission settings allowing `find` command usage

## Expected Development Setup

Once this repository is populated with code, typical commands will likely include:

```bash
# Install dependencies (when package.json is added)
npm install

# Run development server (common pattern)
npm run dev

# Build project (common pattern)  
npm run build

# Run tests (common pattern)
npm test

# Linting (common pattern)
npm run lint
```

## Notes for Future Development

- This repository is currently empty except for basic configuration
- The `.gitignore` suggests Node.js/JavaScript tooling will be used
- Claude Code permissions are configured to allow `find` command usage
- Future instances should check for `package.json`, `README.md`, and other configuration files that may be added
